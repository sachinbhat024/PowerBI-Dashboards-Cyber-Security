# Cyber Security BI Dashboards üîêüìä

This report aims to present valuable 
information to a cyber security department and high-ranking individuals of a company through 
visualisations which have been generated using Power BI. Three different databases were 
created and worked upon to generate dashboards. These databases were named: 

1. Cyber Security Sales Data 
2. Cyber Security Incidents Data 
3. Network Traffic Data

## Objectives of the BI Dashboards 

1. **Cyber Security Sales Data**: 

This dashboard has been created to assist the head CSO (Chief Sales Officer) and cyber security 
sales departments of several companies under one parent company. It keeps a track of the 
product sales by product type across different regions around the globe. This dashboard makes 
it easier to track the type of product a particular company is selling and the revenue it has 
generated. It assists the organisation to monitor and work on areas they are lacking behind. 

2. **Cyber Security Incidents Data**: 

This dashboard has been specifically designed to assist the CISO (Chief Information Security 
Officer) and the cyber security team of a company having its operations in different countries. 
The main objective of this dashboard is to highlight the impact of security incidents and the 
loss it had caused to the organisation. This dashboard keeps a track of the cyber-attacks that 
have been made on the company across the world along with the Incident ID, date, and 
timestamp.

3. **Network Traffic Data**: 

This dashboard has been specifically created to aid the Network Administrator of the 
organisation. It keeps a track of the data exchange (interaction) between computer systems 
using different protocols within the organisation as well as with computer systems outside the 
organisation to determine whether an attack took place or not. Date and timestamps provide 
exact details of the data transfer and cyber attack‚Äôs confirmation.
